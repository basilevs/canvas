# Introduction

![Status: Planned](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Planned-blue)

Technology demonstrator of ASP.NET Core and MongoDB implementing a collaborative web whiteboard. Multiple users can simultaneously draw on a shared canvas with full persistent stroke history, real-time synchronization via SignalR, and the ability to replay or undo the entire drawing timeline.

## 1. Requirements & Constraints

- **REQ-001**: Users can draw freehand strokes on an HTML5 Canvas element in a web browser
- **REQ-002**: Multiple users can collaborate on the same whiteboard simultaneously with live cursor/stroke visibility
- **REQ-003**: All drawing operations are persisted to MongoDB with timestamps and user identity
- **REQ-004**: History and current-state snapshot are served via separate endpoints (snapshot for editing, history for replay/undo). Note: owner visibility filtering of these endpoints is layered on by [feature-visibility-moderation-1.md](./feature-visibility-moderation-1.md) and is not part of the MVP.
- **REQ-005**: Users can create and join named whiteboard sessions via URL
- **REQ-006**: The whiteboard state is reconstructed from snapshot on page load (late joiners see current state)
- **REQ-007**: The first user to access a board becomes its owner; ownership is permanent
- **REQ-015**: Users can choose a pseudonym (display name) shown to other members on the board; stored per-user globally and editable at any time
- **SEC-001**: User identity is bound to the browser instance via a server-issued session token (HttpOnly cookie or SignalR connection token), automatically established on first access — no login or name entry required
- **SEC-002**: Users cannot impersonate another user; the server assigns and validates identity — client-supplied user IDs are never trusted
- **SEC-003**: IP-based rate limiting: configurable request cap per IP range (e.g., /24 subnet) to mitigate abuse from shared networks or botnets
- **SEC-004**: User-based rate limiting: configurable cap on actions (strokes, invites, joins) per user identity per time window to prevent spam and resource exhaustion
- **CON-001**: Target framework is .NET 10.0 (already configured in canvas.csproj)
- **CON-002**: MongoDB Atlas (free tier M0, replica set) is the sole persistence layer — no local MongoDB daemon required
- **CON-003**: Real-time communication must use ASP.NET Core SignalR (WebSocket transport preferred)
- **CON-004**: Frontend must be vanilla JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas (no SPA framework required for demo)
- **CON-005**: MongoDB connection string must be stored in `dotnet user-secrets` (never committed to git)
- **GUD-001**: Follow ASP.NET Core minimal API patterns where applicable; the project already uses minimal APIs + built-in OpenAPI (`AddOpenApi`/`MapOpenApi`) — do not introduce controllers or Swashbuckle
- **GUD-002**: Use MongoDB.Driver official .NET driver (not Entity Framework)
- **GUD-003**: REST endpoints must never expose persistence/domain models (`Board`, `Stroke`, `StrokeEvent`) directly; define `sealed record` response DTOs (e.g. `BoardSummaryResponse`, `BoardSnapshotResponse`, `StrokeResponse`) with `<summary>` XML doc comments, and use `DateTimeOffset` (not `DateTime`) for any date/time fields in DTOs
- **GUD-004**: Every service has an interface (`IMongoDbContext`, `IBoardService`, `IUserProfileService`, `IStrokeEventService`) registered with the interface in DI (`AddSingleton<IBoardService, BoardService>()` etc.); enables mocking in unit tests
- **GUD-005**: Every REST endpoint accepts a `CancellationToken` and forwards it through all async service/driver calls; service method signatures take a trailing `CancellationToken`
- **GUD-006**: REST endpoints follow standard HTTP semantics — `GET` → `200 OK`/`404 Not Found`, `DELETE` → `204 No Content`/`404 Not Found` — and chain OpenAPI metadata (`.WithName().WithSummary().Produces<T>()`); enum values serialize as strings (`JsonStringEnumConverter`)
- **GUD-007**: Use a global exception handler (`IExceptionHandler` in `Middleware/`) with `AddProblemDetails()` + `UseExceptionHandler()`; error responses use RFC 7807 Problem Details, never leaking exception messages
- **GUD-008**: Use MSTest for the automated test projects (aligns with the installed dotnet-test skill set); name tests by what they verify, and label tests that touch MongoDB Atlas as integration tests (not unit tests)
- **PAT-001**: Event-sourcing pattern for stroke history — each stroke is an immutable event
- **PAT-002**: Store temporal metadata (timestamps, point time-offsets, stroke duration) sufficient to reproduce a video-like replay of edits with inactivity gaps compressed or skipped
- **PAT-003**: Maintain a materialized snapshot of the current board state (active strokes only) for fast client loading; full event history is a separate concern used only for replay and undo

## 2. Implementation Steps

### Implementation Phase 1

- GOAL-001: Set up project infrastructure — MongoDB connection, SignalR hub, and static file serving

| Task | Description | Completed | Date |
|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| TASK-001 | Add NuGet packages: `MongoDB.Driver` (latest stable) to `canvas.csproj`. SignalR is included in the framework. | | |
| TASK-002 | Initialize user-secrets: run `dotnet user-secrets init` then `dotnet user-secrets set "MongoDB:ConnectionString" "mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority"`. Add `"MongoDB": { "DatabaseName": "canvas" }` to `appsettings.json` (no secrets in this file). | | |
| TASK-003 | Create `Services/MongoDbContext.cs` (and `IMongoDbContext` interface) — singleton service that reads `MongoDB:ConnectionString` from configuration (user-secrets in dev), exposes `IMongoDatabase` and typed collection accessors for `Boards` and `StrokeEvents` | | |
| TASK-004 | Register services in `Program.cs` via their interfaces: `builder.Services.AddSingleton<IMongoDbContext, MongoDbContext>()`, and likewise `IUserProfileService`/`IBoardService`/`IStrokeEventService` (per GUD-004). Also add `builder.Services.ConfigureHttpJsonOptions(o => o.SerializerOptions.Converters.Add(new JsonStringEnumConverter()))` so enums serialize as strings (GUD-006). | | |
| TASK-005 | Add `builder.Services.AddSignalR()` and map hub endpoint `app.MapHub<WhiteboardHub>("/hub/whiteboard")` in `Program.cs` | | |
| TASK-006 | Create identity middleware in `Middleware/UserIdentityMiddleware.cs`: on each request, check for `X-User-Id` HttpOnly cookie. If absent, generate a new UUID, set it as an HttpOnly/Secure/SameSite=Strict cookie, and attach to `HttpContext.Items["UserId"]`. SignalR hub reads userId from `Context.GetHttpContext().Items["UserId"]` — client never supplies its own identity. | | |
| TASK-007 | Add rate limiting via `Microsoft.AspNetCore.RateLimiting` (built-in). Configure two policies in `Program.cs`: (1) `"ip-range"` — sliding window limiter keyed by client IP /24 subnet (configurable in appsettings: `RateLimits:IpWindowSeconds`, `RateLimits:IpMaxRequests`); (2) `"user"` — sliding window limiter keyed by userId from cookie (configurable: `RateLimits:UserWindowSeconds`, `RateLimits:UserMaxRequests`). Apply both to hub and API endpoints. | | |
| TASK-008 | Create `Middleware/RateLimitKeyProviders.cs` — helper methods: `GetSubnetKey(HttpContext)` (extracts client IP, masks to /24), `GetUserKey(HttpContext)` (reads userId from Items). | | |
| TASK-009 | Add rate limit configuration section to `appsettings.json`: `"RateLimits": { "IpWindowSeconds": 60, "IpMaxRequests": 200, "UserWindowSeconds": 10, "UserMaxRequests": 30 }` (defaults; tunable without redeployment via config reload). | | |
| TASK-010 | Register middleware in `Program.cs`: `app.UseRateLimiter()` before `app.UseMiddleware<UserIdentityMiddleware>()`; identity middleware before `UseStaticFiles`. | | |
| TASK-011 | Add `app.UseStaticFiles()` in `Program.cs` and create `wwwroot/` directory for frontend assets | | |
| TASK-012 | Remove the default weather forecast endpoint (and `WeatherForecast` record) from `Program.cs` | | |
| TASK-053 | Add global error handling (GUD-007): create `Middleware/ApiExceptionHandler.cs` implementing `IExceptionHandler` that maps domain exceptions to RFC 7807 Problem Details (without leaking exception messages); register `builder.Services.AddExceptionHandler<ApiExceptionHandler>()` + `builder.Services.AddProblemDetails()` and `app.UseExceptionHandler()` in `Program.cs`. | | |

### Implementation Phase 2

- GOAL-002: Implement domain models and MongoDB persistence layer for boards and strokes

| Task | Description | Completed | Date |
|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| TASK-013 | Create `Models/Board.cs` — properties: `Id` (ObjectId), `Name` (string), `OwnerId` (string, UUID of first user to access), `IsPublic` (bool, default true), `MembersCanInvite` (bool, default false), `Members` (List<BoardMember>), `CreatedAt` (DateTimeOffset), `LastActivityAt` (DateTimeOffset), `ActiveStrokes` (List<Stroke>, embedded snapshot — includes ALL strokes, filtering applied at serve time). Note: `HiddenRanges` is added by [feature-visibility-moderation-1.md](./feature-visibility-moderation-1.md) | | |
| TASK-014 | Create `Models/BoardMember.cs` — properties: `UserId` (string). Embedded in Board.Members. Note: owner-forced `ForcedName` override is added by [feature-board-administration-1.md](./feature-board-administration-1.md) | | |
| TASK-020 | Create `Models/UserProfile.cs` — properties: `Id` (ObjectId), `UserId` (string, unique, server-assigned UUID), `DisplayName` (string, user-chosen pseudonym, default "Anonymous"), `CreatedAt` (DateTimeOffset). Stored in a `Users` collection. | | |
| TASK-015 | Create `Models/Stroke.cs` — properties: `Id` (ObjectId), `BoardId` (string), `UserId` (string), `Points` (List<Point>), `Color` (string), `Width` (float), `Timestamp` (DateTimeOffset, server-assigned UTC time when stroke was received), `Duration` (long, milliseconds from first point to last point in the stroke as measured by client), `SequenceNumber` (long). | | |
| TASK-016 | Create `Models/StrokeEvent.cs` — properties: `Id` (ObjectId), `BoardId` (string), `Type` (enum: `Add`/`Remove`), `Stroke` (Stroke, the stroke added or removed), `UserId` (string), `Timestamp` (DateTimeOffset), `SequenceNumber` (long). Append-only event log for history replay and undo. | | |
| TASK-017 | Create `Models/Point.cs` — properties: `X` (double), `Y` (double), `Pressure` (double, optional), `TimeOffset` (long, milliseconds since stroke start — enables point-by-point animated replay within a single stroke) | | |
| TASK-018 | Create `Services/UserProfileService.cs` (and `IUserProfileService` interface) — methods (each taking a trailing `CancellationToken`, GUD-005): `GetOrCreateProfileAsync(userId, ct)` (creates with default "Anonymous" name on first access), `SetDisplayNameAsync(userId, name, ct)`, `GetDisplayNameAsync(userId, ct)`, `GetDisplayNamesAsync(userIds, ct)` (batch lookup) | | |
| TASK-019 | Create `Services/BoardService.cs` (and `IBoardService` interface) — methods (each taking a trailing `CancellationToken`, GUD-005): `CreateBoardAsync(name, ownerId)`, `GetBoardAsync(id)`, `GetOrCreateBoardAsync(name, userId)` (first caller becomes owner and member), `UpdateLastActivityAsync(boardId)`, `GetSnapshotAsync(boardName, requestingUserId)`, `GetFullSnapshotAsync(boardName)` (unfiltered, owner-only), `AddStrokeToSnapshotAsync(boardId, stroke)`, `RemoveStrokeFromSnapshotAsync(boardId, strokeId)`, `AddMemberAsync(boardId, userId)`, `IsMemberAsync(boardId, userId)`, `GetMembersWithNamesAsync(boardId)` (returns members with their self-chosen `UserProfile.DisplayName`). Note: administration methods `SetPublicAsync`/`SetMembersCanInviteAsync`/`RemoveMemberAsync` plus forced-name overrides `SetForcedNameAsync`/`ClearForcedNameAsync` (and the `ForcedName ?? DisplayName` resolution) are in [feature-board-administration-1.md](./feature-board-administration-1.md); HiddenRange-based filtering plus `HideContributionsAsync`/`RestoreContributionsAsync`/`GetHiddenRangesAsync` are in [feature-visibility-moderation-1.md](./feature-visibility-moderation-1.md) | | |
| TASK-021 | Create `Services/StrokeEventService.cs` (and `IStrokeEventService` interface) — methods (each taking a trailing `CancellationToken`, GUD-005): `AppendEventAsync(strokeEvent)`, `GetEventsAsync(boardId)` (full history for replay), `GetRecentEventsAsync(boardId, count)` (for undo lookup), `GetEventsSinceAsync(boardId, sequenceNumber)` | | |
| TASK-022 | Create MongoDB indexes: compound index on `StrokeEvents` for `{ BoardId: 1, SequenceNumber: 1 }`, index on `{ BoardId: 1, Timestamp: 1 }` (replay), unique index on `Boards` for `{ Name: 1 }`, unique index on `Users` for `{ UserId: 1 }`, and TTL index on `Boards.LastActivityAt` (optional, 30 days). Note: `Invites` collection indexes are specified in [feature-board-administration-1.md](./feature-board-administration-1.md) | | |

### Implementation Phase 3

- GOAL-003: Implement SignalR hub for real-time collaboration with access control enforcement

| Task | Description | Completed | Date |
|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| TASK-023 | Create `Hubs/WhiteboardHub.cs` implementing `Hub` — all methods resolve userId from `Context.GetHttpContext().Items["UserId"]` (server-assigned, never from client). Methods: `JoinBoard(boardName)`, `LeaveBoard(boardName)`, `SendStroke(boardName, strokeData)`, `UndoLastStroke(boardName)`, `SetDisplayName(name)`. Note: administration methods `JoinBoardWithInvite`/`CreateInvite`/`SetPublic`/`SetMembersCanInvite`/`RemoveMember` plus forced-name overrides `SetForcedName`/`ClearForcedName` are in [feature-board-administration-1.md](./feature-board-administration-1.md); `HideContributions`/`RestoreContributions`/`ToggleShowHidden` are in [feature-visibility-moderation-1.md](./feature-visibility-moderation-1.md) | | |
| TASK-024 | Implement `JoinBoard`: read userId from context, call `UserProfileService.GetOrCreateProfileAsync(userId)`, call `GetOrCreateBoardAsync(name, userId)` (creates the board if absent; first caller is recorded as owner per REQ-007), add the caller as a member and join the board's SignalR group, send the snapshot + member list with display names to the caller, broadcast `UserJoined(userId, displayName)` to the group. Note: private-board access enforcement (reject non-members with `AccessDenied`) is layered onto this flow by [feature-board-administration-1.md](./feature-board-administration-1.md) and does not apply in the MVP, where all boards are public. | | |
| TASK-026 | Implement `SendStroke`: validate stroke data, add to snapshot, append event, broadcast to group. Note: member-access enforcement (verify the caller is a member, reject non-members with `AccessDenied`) is layered onto this method by [feature-board-administration-1.md](./feature-board-administration-1.md); it is a no-op in the MVP, where every joiner is auto-added as a member. | | |
| TASK-027 | Implement `UndoLastStroke`: query recent events for last `Add` by caller, remove from snapshot, append `Remove` event, broadcast `StrokeRemoved(strokeId)`. Note: member-access enforcement (verify the caller is a member, reject non-members with `AccessDenied`) is layered onto this method by [feature-board-administration-1.md](./feature-board-administration-1.md); it is a no-op in the MVP. | | |
| TASK-035 | Implement `SetDisplayName(name)`: any user can call. Validate name (non-empty, max 30 chars). Call `UserProfileService.SetDisplayNameAsync(userId, name)`. Broadcast `UserRenamed(userId, name)` to all groups the user is in. | | |
| TASK-038 | Implement `OnDisconnectedAsync`: remove user from tracking, broadcast `UserLeft` event to relevant groups | | |
| TASK-039 | Add in-memory connection tracking: `ConcurrentDictionary<string, UserConnection>` mapping connectionId to (boardName, userId) for disconnect cleanup and forced removal | | |

### Implementation Phase 4

- GOAL-004: Build the frontend HTML5 Canvas whiteboard with SignalR client integration

| Task | Description | Completed | Date |
|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| TASK-040 | Create `wwwroot/index.html` — page with: board name input (or auto-join via URL path), canvas element (full viewport), color picker, stroke width slider, undo button, display name input (editable), connected users list (showing display names), owner settings panel (hidden for non-owners). Note: invite-token landing UI per [feature-board-administration-1.md](./feature-board-administration-1.md) | | |
| TASK-041 | Add SignalR JavaScript client via CDN: `<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/microsoft-signalr/8.0.0/signalr.min.js"></script>` | | |
| TASK-042 | Create `wwwroot/js/canvas.js` — Canvas drawing module: capture mousedown/mousemove/mouseup and touch events, collect points into stroke objects with `TimeOffset` (ms since stroke start via `performance.now()`), compute `Duration`, render strokes on canvas using `CanvasRenderingContext2D` path API | | |
| TASK-043 | Create `wwwroot/js/connection.js` — SignalR connection module: establish connection to `/hub/whiteboard` (identity via cookie, no client-supplied userId), implement `JoinBoard`, handle `LoadSnapshot`/`StrokeReceived`/`StrokeRemoved`/`UserJoined`/`UserLeft`/`UserRenamed` events. Note: administration events `UserRemoved`/`BoardSettingsChanged`/`Kicked`/`AccessDenied`/`InvalidInvite` and `joinBoardWithInvite` per [feature-board-administration-1.md](./feature-board-administration-1.md); visibility moderation events `StrokesHidden`/`StrokesRestored` per [feature-visibility-moderation-1.md](./feature-visibility-moderation-1.md) | | |
| TASK-044 | Create `wwwroot/js/admin.js` — Owner panel module: show/hide based on ownership. Handle `UserRenamed` to update the members list UI. Note: board administration controls (invites, public/private, member removal, forced names) per [feature-board-administration-1.md](./feature-board-administration-1.md); visibility moderation controls (hide/restore, show-hidden) per [feature-visibility-moderation-1.md](./feature-visibility-moderation-1.md) | | |
| TASK-045 | Create `wwwroot/js/app.js` — Application orchestrator: route join method, wire display name input to `SetDisplayName` on blur/enter, manage board state, handle reconnection, `UserRenamed` (update members list). Note: invite-URL detection and `Kicked` handling per [feature-board-administration-1.md](./feature-board-administration-1.md) | | |
| TASK-046 | Create `wwwroot/css/style.css` — Minimal styling: full-viewport canvas, toolbar overlay, admin panel sidebar, name input, responsive layout | | |
| TASK-047 | Implement `LoadSnapshot` handler: on receiving active strokes array + member list with display names, clear canvas and render all strokes immediately, populate members panel | | |

### Implementation Phase 5

- GOAL-005: Implement REST API endpoints for board management (replay functionality extracted to [feature-replay-history-1.md](./feature-replay-history-1.md))

| Task | Description | Completed | Date |
|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| TASK-054 | Create response DTOs as `sealed record` types in `Dtos/` (GUD-003), each with `<summary>` XML doc comments and `DateTimeOffset` for date/time fields: `BoardSummaryResponse` (name, active stroke count, `LastActivityAt`), `BoardSnapshotResponse` (board name, `IReadOnlyList<StrokeResponse>`), `StrokeResponse` (id, userId, color, width, `IReadOnlyList<PointResponse>`, `Timestamp`), `PointResponse` (x, y, pressure, timeOffset). Map domain models → DTOs in the service/endpoint layer; never serialize `Board`/`Stroke`/`StrokeEvent` directly. | | |
| TASK-036 | Add minimal-API endpoint `GET /api/boards` — returns `200 OK` with `IReadOnlyList<BoardSummaryResponse>` (list of public boards with active stroke counts; no auth). Accept `CancellationToken`, forward it to the service. Chain `.WithName("ListBoards").WithSummary(...).Produces<IReadOnlyList<BoardSummaryResponse>>(200)`. | | |
| TASK-037 | Add minimal-API endpoint `GET /api/boards/{name}/snapshot` — returns `200 OK` with `BoardSnapshotResponse`, or `404 Not Found` if the board does not exist; open access in the MVP (all boards public). Accept `CancellationToken`; use `TypedResults` with an explicit `Results<Ok<BoardSnapshotResponse>, NotFound>` return type; chain `.WithName("GetBoardSnapshot").WithSummary(...).Produces<BoardSnapshotResponse>(200).Produces(404)`. Note: private-board access enforcement (require userId + membership check, return `403`) is layered onto this endpoint by [feature-board-administration-1.md](./feature-board-administration-1.md). | | |
| TASK-048 | Add minimal-API endpoint `DELETE /api/boards/{name}` — owner-only; clears snapshot and all history for a board. Returns `204 No Content` on success, `404 Not Found` if absent. Accept `CancellationToken`; use `TypedResults` with an explicit `Results<NoContent, NotFound>` return type; chain `.WithName("DeleteBoard").WithSummary(...).Produces(204).Produces(404)`. | | |
| TASK-055 | Add a request for each new endpoint (`GET /api/boards`, `GET /api/boards/{name}/snapshot`, `DELETE /api/boards/{name}`) to `canvas.http`, including an error path (non-existent board → 404), matching the port in `Properties/launchSettings.json` (GUD-006). | | |

### Implementation Phase 6

- GOAL-006: Testing, documentation, and deployment setup

| Task | Description | Completed | Date |
|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| TASK-049 | Create `README.md` with: project overview, architecture diagram (text), prerequisites (dotnet 10 SDK, Atlas account), setup instructions (user-secrets configuration), and usage guide | | |
| TASK-050 | Add `.gitignore` entries to ensure user-secrets and `obj/`/`bin/` are excluded | | |
| TASK-051 | Add MSTest integration test (GUD-008): `Tests/WhiteboardHubTests.cs` — verify JoinBoard returns the snapshot and broadcasts `UserJoined`, SendStroke persists and broadcasts, UndoLastStroke removes the caller's last stroke. (Private-board access-denial tests are in [feature-board-administration-1.md](./feature-board-administration-1.md).) | | |
| TASK-052 | Add MSTest integration test (GUD-008): `Tests/StrokeEventServiceTests.cs` — verify event append and query operations against MongoDB Atlas (test database). This exercises a real database, so it is an integration test, not a unit test. | | |

## 3. Alternatives

- **ALT-001**: Use Entity Framework Core with MongoDB provider instead of raw MongoDB.Driver — rejected because EF Core MongoDB support is less mature and this demo aims to showcase direct MongoDB.Driver usage patterns
- **ALT-002**: Use Blazor WebAssembly for the frontend — rejected to keep frontend simple and framework-agnostic, showcasing SignalR interop with vanilla JS
- **ALT-003**: Use Redis Pub/Sub for real-time messaging instead of SignalR — rejected because SignalR is the idiomatic ASP.NET Core solution and supports WebSocket fallback automatically
- **ALT-004**: Use CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) for conflict resolution — rejected as overengineering for a demo; sequential event-sourcing with server-authoritative ordering is sufficient
- **ALT-005**: Use Canvas API library (Fabric.js, Konva) — rejected to minimize dependencies and demonstrate raw Canvas 2D API usage

- **TEST-016**: Manual test — Open two browser tabs on the same board URL, draw in one, verify stroke appears in the other within 100ms
- **TEST-017**: Manual test — Refresh page after drawing; verify all active strokes load instantly from snapshot
- **TEST-018**: Manual test — Click replay button; verify strokes animate in chronological order with inactivity gaps compressed (detailed tests in [feature-replay-history-1.md](./feature-replay-history-1.md))
- **TEST-019**: Manual test — Board administration manual checks (invite link redemption, member removal) are in [feature-board-administration-1.md](./feature-board-administration-1.md)
- **TEST-020**: Manual test — Visibility moderation manual checks are in [feature-visibility-moderation-1.md](./feature-visibility-moderation-1.md)

## 7. Risks & Assumptions

- **RISK-001**: SignalR WebSocket connections may be dropped by proxies/firewalls — mitigated by SignalR's automatic transport fallback (Server-Sent Events → Long Polling)
- **RISK-002**: Atlas network latency (~20-50ms per write) may feel slower than local MongoDB — mitigated by optimistic UI updates (render stroke locally before server confirms persistence)
- **RISK-003**: Large board histories may cause slow page loads — mitigated by pagination and potential future lazy-loading of older strokes
- **RISK-004**: If the HttpOnly cookie is stolen (e.g., via XSS on a related domain), an attacker could impersonate the user — mitigated by using `SameSite=Strict`, `Secure` flags, and no inline scripts
- **ASSUMPTION-001**: MongoDB Atlas M0 cluster is provisioned and accessible (IP allowlist configured)
- **ASSUMPTION-002**: Single-server deployment is sufficient (no SignalR backplane needed for demo scale)
- **ASSUMPTION-003**: Users are identified by a server-assigned UUID delivered via HttpOnly cookie on first request — no login flow, identity persists across sessions in the same browser
- **ASSUMPTION-004**: Browser supports HTML5 Canvas and WebSocket APIs (modern browsers only)
- **ASSUMPTION-005**: Board ownership is permanent and cannot be transferred (simplification for demo)
